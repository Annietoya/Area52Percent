Drexel MSL Voyager Unity Package

This is the current Unity game engine package for communicating with Drexel's Voyager motion platform in the Motion Simulation Lab.

To use, simply import this custom package into your Unity project. (Assets, Import Package, Custom Package...)

Add the TransformWrapper.cs script as a component onto the object that you want to generate the data that will drive the motion platform. This script by default is under Assets, Simulator, Protocol.

If you have questions or comments about this package or the scripts within it, please contact your instructor.
